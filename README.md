# dotfiles

This is my small dotfile repository, first used together with the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux "Wikipedia Explanation for WSL"), but now mainly used for my laptop with [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) installed (previously [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/ "Manjaro Homepage"), which is based on ArchLinux) and my new desktop PC with ArchLinux as well, so most files come from there.

If you want to install Arch Linux on your WSL, look into yuk7's Repository [ArchWSL](https://git.io/archwsl), at least that's how I did it some time ago.
