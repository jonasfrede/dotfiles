# dotfiles

This is my small dotfile repository, first used together with the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux "Wikipedia Explanation for WSL"), but now mainly used for my laptop in combination with [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/ "Manjaro Homepage") as well, so most files come from there.

Both systems are based on [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), but neither of them is pure Arch. If you want to install Arch Linux on your WSL, look into yuk7's Repository [ArchWSL](https://git.io/archwsl), at least that's how I did it some time ago.
